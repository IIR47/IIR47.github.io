I began this sculpture with no intention of what it was going to be. But as I made the first two bends starting from the corner of the board, I was reminded of the shape of my grandparents old house. So I continued, imagining and forming the contours of the building. Even though the wire creates only a skeleton of the house, I see the essence of the house in my sculpture.
